A well-known mining company from northern Chile, dedicated to the extraction of copper and molybdenum, was analyzed as a case study. Regarding the processes, dry tailings are diluted with pressurized water to form a mixture that undergoes several flotation stages aimed at enriching the metals present. The resulting concentrate, composed mainly of copper and molybdenum, is dried, temporarily stored, and finally exported.
