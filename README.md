# **Analysis of Potential Energy Savings in a Rotary Dryer for Copper and Molybdenum Tailings Using Data Mining Techniques**


A well-known mining company in northern Chile, focused on the extraction of copper and molybdenum, was analyzed as a case study. In the process, dry tailings are mixed with pressurized water and undergo multiple flotation stages to enrich the metals. The resulting concentrate, mainly copper and molybdenum, is dried, stored temporarily, and exported.

This process involves various operational variables, generating large volumes of data that can be efficiently analyzed using data mining techniques (DMT).

In this study, the key performance variables of a rotary dryer in the mining industry were identified and analyzed. A linear regression model was built using a feature selection algorithm. The most relevant variables for thermal energy consumption included production rate, power, inlet gas temperature, and product moisture delta. These variables were used to develop the energy versus production curve, which serves as a baseline indicator for process energy consumption.

The energy versus production curve shows the relationship between energy consumed and material processed, typically expressed as energy per unit of production (e.g., kWh/t). This graph helps identify inefficiencies and deviations, providing a reference for evaluating energy efficiency improvements and setting consumption reduction goals.

## Objectives 

1. Conduct an assessment of the current operational situation in the drying stage.
2. Identify the baseline thermal energy consumption curves associated with the drying process.
3. Propose improvements through the proper interpretation of the data obtained.
